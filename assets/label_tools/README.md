# Label Tools

These tools can be used to edit raw labels from the labelling software, generate training data for the ML model, etc.

### Usage

If you are running any script that uses images, make sure to:

1. Download `image_labels.zip` from [Drive -> Vision -> Panel Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QuVk7sfQDHslICtvuUCVxLKNGm4uqmlQ).
2. Extract the images and place them in the `data/images/` relative directory.


### Descriptions

* `image_labels_raw.json` is the raw image labels output from the labelling software.
* `image_labels_edited.json` is the edited and restructured image labels.
* `pair_training_data.json` is the LED pairs data used for training the ML model.
